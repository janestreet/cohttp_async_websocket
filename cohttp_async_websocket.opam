synopsis: "Websocket library for use with cohttp and async"
description: "
Websocket library for use with cohttp and async.

Cohttp_async_websocket is a full-featured server-side
websocket implementation, using Async as the concurrency library,
and Cohttp for HTTP negotiation.

It implements a large portion of RFC6445. The library has been
hardened with many applications using it for several year, in
conjunction with async-js and google-chrome.
